# Kaggle

If you don’t have the basics of machine learning (the theory), I would tell you to go to coursera and take the Andrew Ng course on Coursera : [https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) 

This is because I found the courses on Kaggle to be very very **practice oriented**. Sooner or later, you will need to learn the theory, you could do it in whichever way you want, just choose what you are most comfortable with. 

## My advice for courses on Kaggle

Here you can find the courses offered by kaggle : [https://www.kaggle.com/learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn)

1) After creating your account on kaggle, I suggest you go over basics of **Python** if you aren’t familiar with the language.

2) Then take the **Pandas**, this is to fully understand how to manipulate data.

3) Take the **Intro to Machine Learning** course, there you will build your first “house prices prediction model”, using Random Forests. And Also participate in your first ML competition !!! 

4) Take the **Intermediate Machine Learning** course, there you will learn more stuff (data preprocessing + pipelines) and something called XGBoost that will increase your rankings of the “house prices” competition. An exciting way to see how much you have progressed !!!

5) Then I suggest you take the **Data Visualization** course, you will learn to vizualise your data. This is a key skill like **Pandas** that you will use every time. By using different Charts/plots, you will notice patterns and also irregularities in your models.

6) Lastly, I think you should take **Feature Engineering** course. I am currently taking it. So I can’t say much about it for now 😅.

# 😎 Conclusion

Kaggle is super fun and you will be able to improve a lot by taking the courses there and sharpen your skills in competitions !

Good luck in your Data Science journey 😄.
